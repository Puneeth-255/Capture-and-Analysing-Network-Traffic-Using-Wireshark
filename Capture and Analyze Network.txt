task : : Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

Objective: Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.
Tools: Wireshark 

 Capture and Analyze Network Traffic is a process used to monitor, inspect, and understand the data flowing across a computer network. It's essential for troubleshooting, performance optimization, and security analysis.

- Capture: This involves intercepting packets (units of data) as they travel across the network. Tools like Wireshark or tcpdump are commonly used to do this.
- Analyze: Once captured, the packets are examined to understand their contents, source, destination, protocol, and behavior.

steps involved :-

### Step 1: Install Wireshark and Set Up Capture
- **Download and install Wireshark** from the official website.
- Choose the correct network interface to monitor (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
- Enable promiscuous mode to capture all packets on the network.

###  Step 2: Start Capturing Packets
- Click the shark fin icon to begin capturing.
- Observe live traffic flowing through the interface.
- Stop the capture once you've collected enough data.

###  Step 3: Analyze the Captured Traffic
- Use display filters to isolate specific protocols (e.g., `http`, `tcp.port == 443`).
- Follow TCP streams to view entire conversations.
- Look for anomalies like retransmissions, duplicate ACKs, or out-of-order packets.

### Step 4: Apply Filters and Visual Tools
- Use filters like `ip.addr == 192.168.1---` or `tcp.flags.syn == 1` to narrow down results.
- Color coding helps highlight different types of traffic.
- Use statistics tools to view protocol hierarchies and byte counts.

###  Step 5: Practice and Experiment
- Try capturing traffic from specific websites or applications.
- Simulate network issues (e.g., ping tests, dropped packets) to see how they appear in Wireshark.
