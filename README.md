# Capture-and-Analysing-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark
 Capture and Analyze Network Traffic is a process used to monitor, inspect, and understand the data flowing across a computer network. It's essential for troubleshooting, performance optimization, and security analysis.

- Capture: This involves intercepting packets (units of data) as they travel across the network. Tools like Wireshark or tcpdump are commonly used to do this.
- Analyze: Once captured, the packets are examined to understand their contents, source, destination, protocol, and behavior.

Why Is It Useful?
- Troubleshooting: Identify issues like dropped connections, slow performance, or misconfigured devices.
- Security: Detect malicious activity, unauthorized access, or data breaches.
- Performance Tuning: Spot bottlenecks or inefficient communication between systems.
- Protocol Analysis: Understand how applications communicate (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS).

What Can You See in a Packet?
- Source/Destination IP
- Port Numbers
- Protocol Used (TCP, UDP, etc.)
- Payload (actual data being sent)
- Flags and Headers
